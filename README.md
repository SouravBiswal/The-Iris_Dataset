### The-Iris_Dataset
##### From sklearn.datasets, I've used the iris_dataset to train and test a model using multivariate Logistic regression to classify them into 3 categories namely-Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica by training various samples having four features- Sepal Length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
